# How to use LaTex with Visual Code 

I recently came across a wonderful code editor called Visual Studio Code. It was quite an accident that I came across this editor. I was working on writing my PhD thesis and decided to upgrade my MacOS to Mojave. Well, the upgrade went quite smooth but the following day as I started to work again on my thesis...***well well well***...things didn't go well and LaTeX just wasn't compiling anymore. At that time I was using LaTeX packages from MikTex and TexMaker to do all my LaTeX work. But then as my colleague saw my plight, fighting with my system to make it work...he came to my rescue and recommended me to use Atom. That actually went really well, and I was actually using it until I mentioned it to my husband and he was like " Dude, use this new shit in town, its called VS code" and lo and behold, I downloaded it and here I am now, trying to document how to use it. 

So, you basically need to the following :

## Download VS code for MacOS

Download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download and install it and open it. At this point, you have a screen which looks like this :

## Installing Extensions

* Go to Preferences from the Toolbar and make your way to Extensions, Preferences -> Extensions
* Install Latex Workshop and Code SpellChecker
  
## Preparing a test LaTeX File

Once written, just hit Cmd + S, the \LaTeX workshop extension takes care of the build process automatically. For preview you can either use the Key shortcut Alt+Cmd+V (on MacOS) or simply click on the small magnifying glass next to the opened tabs.

Now you are good to go ! :)
